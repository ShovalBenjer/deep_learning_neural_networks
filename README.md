  - **Mathematical Representation of a Neuron:**
    - **Weighted Sum (Z):**
      $z_i = \sum_{j} w_{ij} x_j + b$
      where $w_{ij}$ are the weights, $x_j$ are the inputs, and $b$ is the bias.
    - **Activation Function (g):**

- **Backpropagation:** The method used to update weights by computing gradients of the loss function.
- **Synaptic Effects:** Difference between excitatory (positive weights) and inhibitory (negative weights) synapses. A positive weight indicates an excitatory connection, while a negative weight indicates an inhibitory connection. The influence of one neuron on another is controlled by the "strength" of the synapse (positive or negative).

- **Types of Neurons:** Introduction to different neuron types, focusing on the Binary Threshold Unit (BTU).
    - **Binary Threshold Unit (BTU)**
      $y_i = \sigma(z_i) =
      \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if } z_i > 0 \\
      0, & \text{if } z_i \leq 0
      \end{cases}$

A hyperplane defined by a vector of $n+1$ weights separates the space into positive and negative regions based on the sign of the dot product $WX$.
    - **Example:**
      For a 2D input, the hyperplane is a straight line:
      $w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b > 0 \quad \text{(Positive)}$
      $w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b \leq 0 \quad \text{(Negative)}$
- **Geometric Interpretation:** A perceptron defines a hyperplane that separates classes.

### Overview & Key Topics
- **Perceptron Learning Algorithm:** An iterative method to adjust weights based on classification errors. The goal is to find weights $W$ that define a separating hyperplane:

  **Steps:**
  1. Initialize weights randomly.
  2. For each training example, compute the output:
     $y_k = \sigma\left(\sum_{j} w_j x_{kj}\right)$
  3. Compute the error:
     $\text{Error} = t_k - y_k$
  4. Update the weights:
     $\Delta w_i = \lambda (t_k - y_k) x_{ki}$
     $w_i = w_i + \Delta w_i$
     where $\lambda$ is the learning rate.

## Lecture 9: Attention Mechanisms, Transformers, and Advanced Topics

**3Blue1Brown Video:**  
[Transformers and Attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VeUPuFGJHk)

### Overview & Key Topics
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Concept and benefits – allowing models to focus on relevant parts of the input.
- **Query-Key-Value Design:** How attention computes compatibility scores to weight different parts of the input.
- **Self-Attention:** Allowing elements of a sequence to interact directly with each other, enabling modeling of long-range dependencies without recurrence.
- **Transformer Architecture:** A deep learning model based entirely on attention mechanisms (multi-head attention, positional encoding, feed-forward networks, residual connections, and layer normalization) without recurrent or convolutional components.
- **Positional Encoding:** Why and how positional information is injected into Transformer inputs.
- **Beam Search:** The search algorithm used to generate sequences in models like Transformers.
- **BERT and XLNet:** Examples of large pre-trained Transformer models and how they achieve state-of-the-art performance in NLP.
- **Applications and Implications:** How attention and Transformers have transformed fields such as machine translation, summarization, and language modeling.

### Quiz (Short Answer) – Sample Questions
1. What is the core purpose of an attention mechanism in Transformers?
2. Explain the query-key-value paradigm in your own words.
3. Why is positional encoding necessary in Transformer models?

### Answer Highlights
- Attention allows the model to weigh different parts of the input differently, effectively "focusing" on the most relevant information.
- In the query-key-value model, a query vector is compared against a set of key vectors to generate attention weights that are then used to combine the corresponding value vectors.
- Without positional encoding, Transformers would have no information about the order of the sequence, as they process all inputs in parallel. Positional encodings supply that ordering information.

### Essay Prompts
- Discuss how multi-head attention improves the model’s ability to capture various relationships in data. What might each head focus on, and why is this diversity beneficial?
- Explain how Transformers differ from RNNs in processing sequences, focusing on parallelism and long-range dependency modeling.

### Glossary
- **Attention Mechanism:** A method that computes a weighted sum of input features where weights reflect the importance of each feature for the current output.
- **Self-Attention:** Attention applied within a single sequence to capture intra-sequence relationships.
- **Transformer:** A neural network architecture based entirely on attention, with no recurrent or convolutional components.
- **Query, Key, Value:** In attention, the query is what you’re comparing, the keys represent the elements to compare against, and the values are the information that is combined according to the attention weights.
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Simultaneously computing multiple attention outputs from different learned projections to capture different aspects of relationships.
- **Positional Encoding:** A method to incorporate sequence order into Transformer inputs.
- **Beam Search:** A heuristic search strategy that explores multiple candidate sequences to generate the most likely output.
- **BERT:** A pre-trained Transformer model that provides deep bidirectional representations, widely used for NLP tasks.
